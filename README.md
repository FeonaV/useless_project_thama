# [Project Name] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Deep think]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Feona] - [CUSAT]
- Member 2: [Thamanna] - [CUSAT]
  

### Project Description
[ A web app that counts how many petals a flower has from a photo- perfect for people who urgently need to know petal counts but can't count themseleves]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[People are wasting precious minutes counting petals manually when they could just‚Ä¶ not.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[An AI-powered (well, sort of) petal counter that takes your flower photo and instantly tells you how many petals it has.
]

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- [python]
- [Streamlit (for web interface)]
- [OpenCV, NumPy, Pillow]
- [VS Code / PyCharm, Browser]
For Hardware:
- [just your computer and a flower photo
- [Specifications:Works best with 800√ó800px images, plain background]
- [Tools: Any device with Python installed]

### Implementation
For Software:User uploads an image via Streamlit web app
OpenCV processes the image: grayscale ‚Üí blur ‚Üí threshold ‚Üí distance transform ‚Üí watershed segmentation.

Segmented petals are colored and counted.

Output image + petal count shown to user.

# Installation
[pip install streamlit opencv-python pillow numpy]

# Run
[streamlit run petal_counter_app.py]

### Project Documentation
For Software:Flow: Upload image ‚Üí Preprocessing ‚Üí Segmentation ‚Üí Petal counting ‚Üí Display results.

Limitations: Works best on clear, top-down flower images with non-overlapping petals. Background clutter may affect accuracy.

Future Improvements: Train deep learning segmentation model for more complex flowers.
